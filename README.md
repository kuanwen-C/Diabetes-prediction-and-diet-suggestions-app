# Abstract

This app harnesses machine learning to predict diabetes and provide personalized diet 
recommendations. Using a Random Forest model, it analyzes user-provided data 
such as age, gender, family history, blood pressure, height, weight, and glucose levels 
to accurately predict the presence or absence of diabetes. The app takes it a step 
further by calculating the user's Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) based on 
their BMI, which is derived from their height and weight, as well as their activity 
level. Utilizing this information, the app offers customized diet suggestions tailored to 
the user's health status, desired diet goals (cutting, bulking, or standard), daily activity 
volume, and diabetes prediction outcome. These suggestions consider macronutrient 
distribution, portion sizes, empowering users to make informed decisions about their 
dietary habits. With its ability to predict diabetes and provide tailored diet plans, this 
app serves as a valuable tool for individuals, particularly those with diabetes, in 
organizing their meals and managing their health effectively.
